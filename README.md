# WeatherApp
## Description
This is a weather application built using Angular 19, designed to provide users weather information, in real time, for various locations worldwide.

## Overview
I implemented an API request to Weather API ([https://www.weatherapi.com/]) to show information about weather for a searched city.
The user searches for a city, presses enter and it will appear informations about minimum and maximum temperature, humidity and wind.
